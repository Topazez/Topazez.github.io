        My still life, VICE, is driven by experiences Iâ€™ve had witnessing addiction and its aftermath. The photo contains a bottle of scotch, several playing cards, and a few stacks of poker chips. One of my main goals when taking this photo was to make it appear messy and unorganized. I wanted to avoid any symmetry or straight lines as best I could. To achieve this, I adjusted the various piles of chips and the deck of cards to appear either defiled or tilted. The ground is covered in dust and dirt, and the lighting is mostly dim aside from one bright flash of light, creating a messy and artificial lighting scheme. The photo was taken in complete darkness using a DSLR camera with a built-in flash and was given minor lighting edits in Photoshop.
