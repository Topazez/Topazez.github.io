        My landscape, Willow Springs Park #2, is a photo of the Port of Long Beach taken from Willow Springs Park. The photo’s foreground displays vibrant greenery behind which stands a line of cranes. During post production, I knew I wanted to make a vibrant image as most of my recent photos had either had darker color schemes and lighting or been black and white. To achieve this, I began experimenting with various color theory techniques, using green as my main color. In the end I chose colors analogous to green, and adjusted the image’s trees to contain a slight yellow shade and gave the sky a teal tint.
