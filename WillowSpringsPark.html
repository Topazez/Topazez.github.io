        My landscape, Willow Springs Park #2, is a photo of the Port of Long Beach taken from Willow Springs Park in Signal Hill. The photo’s foreground displays vibrant greenery, behind which stands a line of cranes. During post production, I knew I wanted to make a vibrant image as most of my recent photos had either darker color schemes and lighting or were black and white. To achieve this, I began experimenting with various color theory techniques, using green as my main color. In the end, I chose colors analogous to green, adjusted the image’s trees to contain a slight yellow shade, and gave the sky a teal tint.
