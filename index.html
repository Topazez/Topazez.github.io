        <span style="background-color: rgba(196, 194, 194, 0.5);">Everyone has a unique view of the world and photography is how I choose to show mine. For this portfolio, I took 7 images showing how I see certain objects, buildings, and environments. The subjects in these photos include people, buildings, landscapes, and food.</span>

        <span style="background-color: rgba(196, 194, 194, 0.5);">During a shoot, I generally use a Sony DLSS camera, although at times I am forced to use an iPhone. During post production I use Photoshop and Lightroom for minor edits to color and clarity. When composing a photo, I usually have an idea of what I want to create when I first see my subject. These subjects are often inanimate, allowing me to experiment with lighting, framing, and point of view to create an image as close to what I first envision as possible. I am mostly influenced by my own desire to try as many types of photography as I can in an attempt to find what I enjoy and best convey my ideas. One of the pictures that best encapsulates this is “Grand Avenue Building,” a skyscraper in downtown LA I saw while visiting The Broad. When I first saw the building, I immediately imagined looking up at the building, towering against a sky filled with clouds. I approached the base of the building and pointed my camera up at the seemingly endless wall of windows resulting in the building looking almost translucent in the final photo.</span>
